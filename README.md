# <img src="./public/temp-logo.png" alt="Description of Image" width="30" height="30"> Dyne – Frontend

A swipe-based restaurant discovery web app that helps you decide **where to eat nearby** without overthinking.
Swipe right to like, left to skip, and save places for later.

Built for **Alamdea Hackathon** - a **10-day hackathon** by a team of 4.

## What is Dyne?

Choosing a restaurant with friends is painful. Endless scrolling, reviews, and arguments.

Dyne fixes that by:

- Showing **one restaurant at a time**
- Letting users **swipe** to like, skip, or save
- Keeping **Liked** and **Saved** restaurants organized
- Focusing on speed, simplicity, and clean UI

Think **Tinder, but for food**.
